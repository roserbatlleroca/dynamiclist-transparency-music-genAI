# Dynamic List: Transparency in Music-Generative AI

This repository is linked to the article [*Transparency in Music-Generative AI: A Systematic Literature Review*](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3708077/v1) by R. Batlle-Roca, E. GÃ³mez, W. H. Liao, X. Serra and Y. Misufuji. The intention of the article is to examine the literature on AI transparency in the context of music-generative AI, focusing on the links between transparency, artificial intelligence, music generation, the evaluation of creativity and originality and the connections to intellectual property rights. In the last version of the review (currently under review), we presented a comprehensive two-stage review of 107 identified publications published until June 2024, highlighting an increasing interest in AI transparency and the ethical consequences of generative models.

Given the rapid advancements in generative AI within the music domain, the goal of this repository is to provide a continuously updated **dynamic and live literature review list** (from newest to oldest). It includes a categorised list of publications that reflects new research and developments of AI transparency for music generation, helping the community stay informed on the latest progress in this evolving field.
